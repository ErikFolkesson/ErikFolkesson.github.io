Website ideas to implement: 

General: 
- TODO list inside each category and a DEV-TODO
- A reading list inside each category
- Color scheme!
- Collection of websites
- Acces to files directly inside the website (be able to modify, add new folders etc.)

Personal: 
- Random recipe suggestor

Study: 
- A example study schedule that I can use for each day (Lecture -> Notes -> Repetition -> Practise)
- A list of good study methods and "rules" to follow
